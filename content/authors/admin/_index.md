Hi there! I am a Masters student of Computer Science, currently studying at Saarland University in the city of Saarbrücken in Germany. I am also a research assistant and thesis student at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems. I am interested in research topics that broadly encompass machine learning and its applications in the social context. I am particularly interested in the aspects of fairness, interpretability, robustness and privacy of the applications of such systems in social domains, natural language processing, vision, etc.

I am currently looking for available positions for pursuing a PhD in order to work on challenging and interesting problems in my topics of interest.
